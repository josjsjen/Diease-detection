# Disease detection from X-ray scans 

I will introduce you to using a convolutional network to tackle a realistic dataset in medical diagnostics. Specifically, we use the ChestXRay dataset, a set of X-ray images labeled with corresponding diagnoses.

## Data
The ChestXRay dataset consists of over 100,000 different X-rays from more than 30,000 patients labeled with different disease conditions. Our goal for this lab is to use a subset of the dataset to train a classifier that is able to accurately infer the presence of pneumothorax.
